Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Chinaâ€™s
Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in a coronavirus pandemic. As of 3 May 2020, more than
3.44 million cases have been reported across 187 countries and territories, resulting in more than 244,000
deaths.

This virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by
coughing, sneezing, or talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than remaining in
the air over long distances. A such, people become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then
touching their face. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread
may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.

European countries have been hit much harder than Asian nations and have spread the virus significantly more
than other regions. . A major reason behind this is because European countries were late to close their air links,
consequently facilitating the spread through air travel.

This study aims at examining the effects of COVID-19 in Europe, particularly the daily deaths caused by this
disease.
